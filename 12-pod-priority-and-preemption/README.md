Pod Priority and Preemption are mechanisms to help the scheduler make decisions when resources are scarce. They ensure that more important workloads are scheduled before less important ones.

**Pod Priority**

Pod Priority is a way to assign importance to Pods. It helps the scheduler decide which Pods to schedule first when there are limited resources.
* Priority is defined by an integer value.
* A higher number = higher priority.
* You set priority using a PriorityClass.

**Pod Preemption**

Preemption happens when a high-priority Pod canâ€™t be scheduled because of insufficient resources. The scheduler may evict (delete) lower-priority Pods to make room for it.
* Preemption respects PodDisruptionBudgets and Pod affinity/anti-affinity rules.
* Preempted Pods are terminated, not just paused.

Usage Considerations:
* Use preemption sparingly, as it can disrupt workloads.
* Protect critical Pods using PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).
* Avoid frequent evictions by tuning resource requests/limits and priorities carefully.

Summary:
* Pod Priority: Numerical value that tells the scheduler which Pod is more important.
* Preemption: The act of evicting lower-priority Pods to make room for higher-priority ones.
